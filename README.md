# Minimal Spring WebApp with OAuth2 Login

This project provides a minimal Spring web application (using Thymeleaf for templating) that leverages an OAuth2 provider for logging in. The idea here is that you will avoid managing account information in the application itself, the OAuth2 provider (GitHub, Google, Microsoft, etc.) will handle all of the messy account and password management stuff for you.

There's a whole blog article that goes with this project, you can check it out at...
